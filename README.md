GETIN is the place where community and transportation come together. There's more to our app than just ride-hailing. 
It's a platform that links travellers with other individuals who are going in the same direction, increasing accessibility, affordability, and satisfaction of travel for all.
Imagine that you're traveling within the city to run errands or get to work. 
You can check if there are any passengers on your route by opening the GETIN app, rather than navigating through traffic on your own.
Just enter your destination, and our algorithm will locate other travellers who are headed in your direction. 
You'll be matched with passengers who share similar routes, allowing you to ride together.
By travelling using get in, you can cut down on carbon emissions and traffic congestion in addition to saving money on transportation costs. 

The environment, the traveller as well as the user will benefit from it. 

GETIN provides a convenient, reliable transportation option that prioritizes people, whether you're a student, a daily commuter, or just someone looking for a lift.
